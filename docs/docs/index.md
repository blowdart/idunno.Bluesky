# What is the `idunno.Bluesky` library?

`idunno.Bluesky` provides a set of classes for reading from, and posting to the [Bluesky social network](https://bsky.social/).

Bluesky's own HTTP Reference can be found in their [documentation](https://docs.bsky.app/docs/category/http-reference).

The [current and planned APIs](endpointStatus.md) contains information on the library classes that implement Bluesky or AT Proto APIs along with the Bluesky and AT Proto endpoints they call.
