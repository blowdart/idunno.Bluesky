## Getting Started

Add the `idunno.Bluesky` package to your project, and then 

```c#
BlueskyAgent agent = new ();

var loginResult = await agent.Login(username, password);
if (loginResult.Succeeded)
{
    var response = await agent.CreatePost("Hello World");
    if (response.Succeeded)
    {
    }
}
```

Please see the [documentation](https://bluesky.idunno.dev/) for much more useful documentation and samples.

## Release History

The [releases page](https://github.com/blowdart/idunno.Bluesky/releases) provides details of each release and what was added, changed or removed.


## Release Verification

The project uses an Authenticode certificate to sign assemblies and to author sign the nupkg packages.
nuget validates the signatures during its publication process.

To validate these signatures use

```
dotnet nuget verify [<package-path(s)>]
```

The subject name of the signing certificate should be

```Subject Name: CN=Barry Dorrans, O=Barry Dorrans, L=Bothell, S=Washington, C=US```

In addition, for GitHub artifact signing the project uses [minisign](https://github.com/jedisct1/minisign) with the following public key.

```
RWTsT4BHHChe/Rj/GBAuZHg3RaZFnfBDqaZ7KzLvr44a7mO6fLCxSAFc
```

To validate a file using an artifact signature from a [release](https://github.com/blowdart/idunno.Bluesky/releases)
download the `.nupkg` from nuget and the appropriate `.minisig` from the release page, then use the following command,
replacing `<package-path>` with the file name you wish to verify.

```
minisign -Vm <package-path> -P RWTsT4BHHChe/Rj/GBAuZHg3RaZFnfBDqaZ7KzLvr44a7mO6fLCxSAFc
```

## License

`idunno.Bluesky`, `idunno.AtProto` and `idunno.AtProto.OAuthCallBack` are available under the MIT license, see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for more information.

## Planned work

### Major

* Logging in idunno.Bluesky
* GIF attaching
* Wider test coverage
* More deserialization tests with captured responses

### Awaiting external

* Automatic Open Graph card generation when link facets detected.

## Dependencies

`idunno.AtProto` takes a dependency on `System.Text.Json` v9 to support deserializing derived types where the `$type` property is not the
first property in the JSON object.
